## Overview

## My process

- The first thing I did was to style the body and proceed to style every class in the HTML code.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learnded to use Google Wbtools for checking why some CSS property didn't work out the way I intended and what should I change to make look the elememts in that specific way.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css  
// proud of using flex property
body{
    /* used flex to move the content on the page */
    display: flex;
    font-size: 15px;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    /* set to center the content of the body */
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin-top: 2rem;
    /* items aligned colums */
    flex-direction: column;
    margin: 10% 10% 10% 10%;
    height: 20%;
}

// I had hard time figuring out this
.card-body {
    padding: 2rem 1rem;   
}


### Continued development

I want to learn to boxing content in the web page more accurately and using margin and padding the rigth way.

### Useful resources

- (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/contain) - This helped me for understanding the concept of a container.
-(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/) This helped me to create a simple card container. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
